class ScalarFunction:
    """Scalar function and its derivatives.

    This class defines a scalar function F: R^n->R and methods for
    computing or approximating its first and second derivatives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        evaluates the scalar function. Must be of the form ``fun(x, *args)``,
        where ``x`` is the argument in the form of a 1-D array and ``args`` is
        a tuple of any additional fixed parameters needed to completely specify
        the function. Should return a scalar.
    x0 : array-like
        Provides an initial set of variables for evaluating fun. Array of real
        elements of size (n,), where 'n' is the number of independent
        variables.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any additional fixed parameters needed to completely specify the scalar
        function.
    grad : {callable, '2-point', '3-point', 'cs'}
        Method for computing the gradient vector.
        If it is a callable, it should be a function that returns the gradient
        vector:

            ``grad(x, *args) -> array_like, shape (n,)``

        where ``x`` is an array with shape (n,) and ``args`` is a tuple with
        the fixed parameters.
        Alternatively, the keywords  {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} can be used
        to select a finite difference scheme for numerical estimation of the
        gradient with a relative step size. These finite difference schemes
        obey any specified `bounds`.
    hess : {callable, '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', HessianUpdateStrategy}
        Method for computing the Hessian matrix. If it is callable, it should
        return the  Hessian matrix:

            ``hess(x, *args) -> {LinearOperator, spmatrix, array}, (n, n)``

        where x is a (n,) ndarray and `args` is a tuple with the fixed
        parameters. Alternatively, the keywords {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'}
        select a finite difference scheme for numerical estimation. Or, objects
        implementing `HessianUpdateStrategy` interface can be used to
        approximate the Hessian.
        Whenever the gradient is estimated via finite-differences, the Hessian
        cannot be estimated with options {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} and needs
        to be estimated using one of the quasi-Newton strategies.
    finite_diff_rel_step : None or array_like
        Relative step size to use. The absolute step size is computed as
        ``h = finite_diff_rel_step * sign(x0) * max(1, abs(x0))``, possibly
        adjusted to fit into the bounds. For ``method='3-point'`` the sign
        of `h` is ignored. If None then finite_diff_rel_step is selected
        automatically,
    finite_diff_bounds : tuple of array_like
        Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds,
        (-np.inf, np.inf). Each bound must match the size of `x0` or be a
        scalar, in the latter case the bound will be the same for all
        variables. Use it to limit the range of function evaluation.
    epsilon : None or array_like, optional
        Absolute step size to use, possibly adjusted to fit into the bounds.
        For ``method='3-point'`` the sign of `epsilon` is ignored. By default
        relative steps are used, only if ``epsilon is not None`` are absolute
        steps used.

    Notes
    -----
    This class implements a memoization logic. There are methods `fun`,
    `grad`, hess` and corresponding attributes `f`, `g` and `H`. The following
    things should be considered:

        1. Use only public methods `fun`, `grad` and `hess`.
        2. After one of the methods is called, the corresponding attribute
           will be set. However, a subsequent call with a different argument
           of *any* of the methods may overwrite the attribute.
